# Difficulty Progression System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented an adaptive difficulty progression system for the DynamicQuestionBank that automatically adjusts question difficulty based on student performance.

## Core Implementation

### 1. DynamicQuestionBank Class (`src/utils/questions/index.js`)

Added the following properties and methods to the `DynamicQuestionBank` class:

#### New Properties:
- `difficulty`: Current difficulty level ('easy', 'medium', or 'hard')
- `consecutiveCorrect`: Counter for consecutive correct answers
- `consecutiveIncorrect`: Counter for consecutive incorrect answers
- `correctTimes`: Array tracking response times for recent correct answers

#### New Methods:

**`updateDifficulty(wasCorrect, timeSpent)`**
- Tracks student performance after each answer
- **Difficulty Increase Logic:**
  - After 3 consecutive correct answers
  - AND all answers completed in < 10 seconds each
  - Progression: easy → medium → hard
- **Difficulty Decrease Logic:**
  - After 2 consecutive incorrect answers
  - Regression: hard → medium → easy
- Returns the new difficulty level

**`resetDifficulty()`**
- Resets difficulty to 'easy'
- Clears all tracking counters
- Called when starting a new quiz

**`getDifficulty()`**
- Returns current difficulty level

#### Modified Methods:

**`generateUniqueQuestion(generatorNames, maxAttempts, difficulty)`**
- Now accepts optional `difficulty` parameter
- Passes difficulty to question generators
- Adds `difficultyLevel` metadata to generated questions
- Generators without difficulty support safely ignore the parameter

## Question Generator Updates

### 2. Clock Time Questions (`src/utils/questions/clockTime.js`)

Updated all 6 generators to support difficulty levels:

#### `generateReadingClock(difficulty)`
- **Easy**: Only o'clock and half past (0, 30 minutes)
- **Medium**: Quarter intervals (0, 15, 30, 45 minutes)
- **Hard**: All 5-minute intervals (0, 5, 10, ..., 55 minutes)

#### `generateTimeElapsed(difficulty)`
- **Easy**: Simple 30-minute and 1-hour intervals
- **Medium**: 15-90 minute intervals with quarter-hour starts
- **Hard**: Complex intervals up to 150 minutes with 5-minute precision

#### `generateTimeDifference(difficulty)`
- **Easy**: Hour differences limited to 2 hours, simple times
- **Medium**: Up to 4-hour differences with quarter intervals
- **Hard**: Any 5-minute interval differences

#### `generateScheduleProblem(difficulty)`
- **Easy**: 1-2 activities with simple times
- **Medium**: 2-3 activities with quarter-hour precision
- **Hard**: 3-4 activities with complex timing

#### `generateClockAngles(difficulty)`
- **Easy**: Only simple angles (right angle, straight angle) at o'clock
- **Medium**: Adds quarter-hour positions
- **Hard**: Includes acute and obtuse angles at various times

#### `generateTimeWordProblem(difficulty)`
- **Easy**: 2-step problems with simple on-the-hour starts
- **Medium**: Multi-step problems with quarter-hour precision
- **Hard**: Complex 5+ step problems with irregular times

### 3. 2D/3D Shape Questions (`src/utils/questions/shapes2D3D.js`)

Updated 5 key generators:

#### `generateShapeIdentification(difficulty)`
- **Easy**: Simple shapes only (triangle, square, rectangle)
- **Medium**: Adds pentagon and hexagon
- **Hard**: All shapes including circle

#### `generateCountVertices2D(difficulty)`
- **Easy**: Only 3-4 sided shapes
- **Medium**: Up to 5 sides (pentagon)
- **Hard**: All shapes including hexagon

#### `generate3DProperties(difficulty)`
- **Easy**: Simple 3D shapes (cube, sphere, cylinder), only asks about faces
- **Medium**: Adds cuboid/cone, asks about faces and edges
- **Hard**: All 3D shapes including prisms/pyramids, asks about all properties

#### `generateShapeAngles(difficulty)`
- **Easy**: Only triangle and square angle questions
- **Medium**: Adds rectangle and pentagon
- **Hard**: Includes hexagon with more complex angle calculations

#### `generateComplexShapeProperties(difficulty)`
- **Easy**: Redirects to simple 2D vertex counting
- **Medium**: Simple 3D property questions
- **Hard**: Complex multi-property calculations

## Difficulty Progression Algorithm

### Progression Rules:

1. **Start State**: All users begin at 'easy' difficulty

2. **Level Up** (Easy → Medium → Hard):
   - Requires: 3 consecutive correct answers
   - AND: Each answer completed in < 10 seconds
   - Effect: Resets consecutive counter, clears time tracking

3. **Level Down** (Hard → Medium → Easy):
   - Requires: 2 consecutive incorrect answers
   - Effect: Resets consecutive counter, clears time tracking

4. **State Persistence**:
   - Difficulty persists across question navigation
   - Resets to 'easy' when starting a new quiz

### Performance Tracking:
- Tracks last 3 correct answer times (sliding window)
- Only evaluates speed when 3+ correct answers accumulated
- Incorrect answer clears time tracking (requires consistency)

## Integration Points for SevenPlusQuizApp.js

To complete the integration, the following changes should be made to `SevenPlusQuizApp.js`:

### State Management:
```javascript
const [difficulty, setDifficulty] = useState('easy');
```

### Answer Handling:
```javascript
// In nextQuestion() function, before advancing:
const current = questions[currentQuestion];
const timeSpent = answerTimes[currentQuestion] || 0;
const wasCorrect = /* check if answer is correct */;
const newDifficulty = questionBank.updateDifficulty(wasCorrect, timeSpent);
setDifficulty(newDifficulty);
```

### Quiz Reset:
```javascript
// In resetQuiz() function:
questionBank.resetDifficulty();
setDifficulty('easy');
```

### UI Display:
- Add difficulty indicator showing current level
- Display progression hints ("Get 3 correct in <10s to level up!")
- Show difficulty badge on each question

## Example Question Scaling

### Clock Time - Reading Clocks

**Easy:**
- Question: "What time is shown on the clock?"
- Times: 3:00, 7:30, 12:00 (o'clock and half past only)

**Medium:**
- Question: "What time is shown on the clock?"
- Times: 3:15 (quarter past), 7:45 (quarter to), 2:30 (half past)

**Hard:**
- Question: "What time is shown on the clock?"
- Times: 3:25, 7:55, 2:10 (any 5-minute interval)

### Shapes - 3D Properties

**Easy:**
- Question: "How many faces does a cube have?"
- Shapes: Cube, sphere, cylinder
- Property: Faces only

**Medium:**
- Question: "How many edges does a cuboid have?"
- Shapes: Cube, cuboid, sphere, cylinder, cone
- Properties: Faces and edges

**Hard:**
- Question: "How many vertices does a triangular prism have?"
- Shapes: All 3D shapes
- Properties: Faces, edges, vertices
- May include calculations

### Algebra - Symbol Equations

**Easy:**
- Values: 2-4 range
- 2 symbols maximum
- Simple addition

**Medium:**
- Values: 3-8 range
- 3 symbols
- Multiple operations

**Hard:**
- Values: 4-11 range
- Complex multi-symbol equations
- Advanced problem-solving

## Backward Compatibility

The system maintains full backward compatibility:

1. **Optional Parameters**: All difficulty parameters default to 'medium'
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Generators without difficulty support work normally
3. **No Breaking Changes**: Existing question generation continues to function
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: New generators can add difficulty support incrementally

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Progression Testing**:
   - Answer 3 questions correctly in < 10 seconds each
   - Verify difficulty increases from easy → medium → hard

2. **Regression Testing**:
   - Answer 2 questions incorrectly
   - Verify difficulty decreases appropriately

3. **Speed Requirement**:
   - Answer correctly but slowly (> 10 seconds)
   - Verify difficulty does NOT increase

4. **Question Quality**:
   - Generate 20 questions at each difficulty level
   - Verify complexity matches expected difficulty

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to the difficulty system:

1. **Granular Difficulty**: Add sub-levels (easy-1, easy-2, easy-3)
2. **Category-Specific Difficulty**: Track difficulty per question category
3. **Adaptive Timing**: Adjust time thresholds based on question type
4. **Performance Analytics**: Store difficulty progression in database
5. **Custom Difficulty Curves**: Allow teachers to configure progression rules
6. **Difficulty Badges**: Award badges for maintaining hard difficulty
7. **Smart Reset**: Consider partial difficulty retention across sessions
