Welcome! This project contains a collection of friendly educational games aimed at helping children practise key maths skills. The activities are built with React and can be used online at <https://drdedge.github.io/clock-learning-app>.

## What's Included

The app suite currently offers five mini‑apps:

1. **Clock Learning** – Set the hands on an analogue clock and learn to read the time.

3. **Cake Fractions** – Visualise how a cake can be divided into halves, quarters and more.
4. **Number Line Fractions** – Place fractions correctly on a number line.
5. **7+ Math Practice** – A 20‑question quiz covering a range of year‑group topics.

## Syllabus Overview

The 7+ Math Practice quiz draws from many types of question generators, including:

- Word problems
- Money calculations
- Number patterns
