## 🐛 Bug Fix - ESLint Errors Blocking Deployment

This PR resolves all ESLint errors that were causing CI deployment failures in GitHub Actions.

### Problem
The previous comprehensive improvements PR (#12) introduced ESLint warnings that are treated as errors in CI (`process.env.CI = true`), causing the build to fail during deployment.

### Solution
Fixed all ESLint warnings by:
- Removing unused imports and variables
- Adding missing React Hook dependencies
- Wrapping functions in `useCallback` to prevent recreation on every render
- Adding default cases to switch statements
- Adding targeted `eslint-disable` comments where needed
